# ViewFaster

## Application Description
Our website is used for guests to view guided schedules/workable online links for movie and television media for the present and the past using secondary API’s through IMDB and TVMaze. A huge proponent of our development is ease of use and remembrance: both visually and client side. There’s nothing like getting excited for a specific piece of media and then scouring each individual streaming service trying to find where it can be found and/or how many doubloons it’ll cost me. Motivation can be boiled down to the name we gave this project: ViewFaster. At your fingertips you can find tens of thousands of media titles and view them as promptly as you can type.

## Usage
1. Navigate to the [application](https://estee3.github.io/1st-Project/)
2. Enter part or all of a TV show and/or a Movie name
3. Click on the appropriate search button to execute the API call
4. Use the results to plan your media consumption needs

## Application Features
- Auto-fit width of all sections, including our company logo
- Saves all searches within local storage according to the search field used (TV vs. Movie)
- All proceeding searches will auto-clear the current search so that concatenation does not occur, leading to a cleaner experience
- Search results will provide official links to the shows/movies that are returned within the results, providing a more in-depth way to decide on your media consumption needs
- Specific to TV Show searches: The upcoming days and times for when it will air, are provided to the end user
